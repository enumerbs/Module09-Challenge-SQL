# Implementation notes

Data Modelling:
- The Entity Relationship Diagram (see results section above) was developed using 'QuickDBD' ( https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/ ) after inspecting the supplied CSV data files.
- Textual description used in QuickDBD to create the ERD is saved in 'ERD-QuickDBD-definition.txt'
- Schema creation script in Postgres syntax for the tables & relationships defined, exported from QuickDBD, is saved in 'QuickDBD-export-schema-creation.sql'.
